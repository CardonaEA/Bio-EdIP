# Bio-EdIP: An Automatic Approach for In vitro Cell Confluence Images Quantification (*)

Bio-EdIP is a friendly GUI developed in MATLAB® 2012a software. Bio-EdIP segments cell-free regions (background), detecting indirectly those regions covered by cells. It therefore allows a quantitative analysis of cell confluence levels using in vitro culture images, including but not limited to wound healing, scattered, and seeded cells.

Bio-EdIP does not requiere MATLAB but it runs using Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR v.7.8).

# Please note:
### This GitHub repository containes the scripts used to compile Bio-EdIP

## Downloading Bio-EdIP

**To make use of Bio-EdIP**, plase download “Bio-EdIP_User Manual 2017.pdf” and follow the instructions for downloading and installing Bio-EdIP.

**To run Bio-EdIP**, Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR v.7.8) is needed. This program is included when installing “Bio-EdIP.rar”. One can also install “Bio-EdIP (without MCR).rar”, if MCR is already installed in you computer.

**Please note** that Bio-EdIP user manual includes examples of use. Example images together with our annotated data can be downloaded as well (“Constructed datasets.rar”).
